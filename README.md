# "Indlela ibuzwa kwabaphambili" A bittorent like peer-to-peer Network


## Goal
An app to allow for a local bit torrent network where users can share apps, files.. my interests re-inspired by El-Paquete and Sneakercon.

Things to do:
* Independently download different parts of a file 
* Download file based on available sources
* Re-Add file if needed once downloaded

Niceties:
* Create an Identity
* Encrypt file
* Decrypt file
